### Sprint 1

H001: As a user, I want a header that displays the application logo and a navigation bar to facilitate site navigation

Acceptance criteria:

1. The header should occupy 100% of the screen on all application pages.
2. The header should remain fixed at the top of the page, even when scrolling, to ensure it is always visible and accessible to the user.
3. The header should be consistent across all application pages and should be user-friendly and easy to understand.
4. The header should be optimized for different devices and screen resolutions.
5. Within the header, there should be a left-aligned block containing the company logo and slogan.
6. Clicking on the logo or slogan should redirect the user to the main page of the application.
7. Within the header, there should be a right-aligned block containing two buttons: “Create Account” and “Log In” (non-functional)

Responsive, media querys, footer a la izquierda.
